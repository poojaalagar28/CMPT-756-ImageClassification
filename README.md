# Image Classification App üñºÔ∏èüîç

This application allows you to classify images using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Upload an image and the app will predict the most likely labels for the image!

## How it works

1. **Upload Image**: Upload an image file (JPEG, JPG, or PNG) that you want to classify.
2. **Image Classification**: The app will use the RESNET50 model to predict the labels for the uploaded image.
3. **Display Results**: The top predicted labels along with their confidence scores are displayed, along with the image.

## How to use

### Running the app locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. üñ•Ô∏è
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. üõ†Ô∏è
4. Run the Flask app using the command: python main.py.
5. Access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

### Docker containerization

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to build the Docker image:
     ```
     docker build -t image-classification-app:latest .
     ```
   - This command will build a Docker image named `image-classification-app` with the latest tag.

2. **Run Docker Container**:
   - Once the Docker image is built successfully, you can run a Docker container using the following command:
     ```
     docker run -p 5000:5000 image-classification-app:latest
     ```
   - This command will start a Docker container based on the `image-classification-app` image and map port 5000 on your local machine to port 5000 in the container.

3. **Access the App**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Image Classification App running inside the Docker container. üö¢

## Example

Suppose you upload an image of a dog. The app will predict that the image contains a "golden retriever" with a confidence score of 0.8 (80%). Additionally, it will suggest other possible labels and their confidence scores.

### GCP Deployment (GKE - Serverful)

1. Prerequisites:

2. Download and install the gcloud CLI.
Install and set up kubectl with your GKE cluster. Instructions can be found in GCP documentation.
Create a repository in the Artifact Registry in GCP.

3. Create GKE cluster:
   ```gcloud container clusters create-auto <cluster_name> --region <region_name>```

4. Build and push images to GCP Artifact Registry. Replace <region_name>, <project_name>, and <artifactory_repo_name> accordingly.

5. Deploy services using kubectl:
   ```kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml```
   ```kubectl apply -f service.yaml```
   
   Access the app by visiting the 'EXTERNAL IP' in your web browser.

### GCP Deployment (Cloud Run - Serverless)

1. Build and push the Docker image using the configuration in your cloudbuild.yaml.

2. Deploy to Cloud Run: Use the gcloud commands in your cloudbuild.yaml to deploy your service.
   
3. Access the app by visiting the service URL provided by Cloud Run.
